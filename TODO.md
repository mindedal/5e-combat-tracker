1) Encounter Persistence + Shareable Sessions
Let users save encounters (party + monsters + initiative + HP + conditions) to local storage file, and generate a shareable link for co-DMs or players.
Value: makes the app usable beyond one-off sessions.

1) Conditions & Status Engine
Add a system for conditions (e.g., Stunned, Poisoned, Grappled) with:

automatic round countdowns,
effect reminders,
per-turn triggers.
Value: reduces DM cognitive load a lot.
3) Monster + Spell Importer
Allow users to paste or import stat blocks/spells (SRD or custom) and build a library.
Value: speeds up encounter setup dramatically.

4) Turn Automation + Reactions Queue
Implement a reaction/interrupt queue and optional “auto-advance” to the next turn when all actions are resolved.
Value: fast-paced table flow.

5) Player View / Second Screen Mode
Provide a “player display” with minimal info (initiative order, public HP bars, round counter).
Value: huge usability boost in live games.
