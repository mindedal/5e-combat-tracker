# Quickstart: Encounter Persistence & Shareable Sessions

## Goal

Save encounters locally and generate shareable links so collaborators can load the same snapshot.

## Save an Encounter

1. Open or create an encounter.
2. In **Encounter Tools**, click **Save Encounter**.
3. Provide an optional name (e.g., "Goblin Ambush").
4. Confirm the save in the saved encounters list.

## Load a Saved Encounter

1. Open the **Saved Encounters** list in **Encounter Tools**.
2. Select a saved entry.
3. Confirm load to restore the encounter state (initiative, HP, conditions).

## Share an Encounter Snapshot

1. Click **Generate Link**.
2. Click **Copy Link** to copy the generated URL.
3. Send the link to a co-DM or player.

## Open a Shared Link

1. Open the shared link in the browser.
2. Review the **Shared Snapshot** preview.
3. Click **Load Snapshot** to restore it into the tracker.

## Troubleshooting

- **Link too long**: Reduce encounter size or simplify participants and try again.
- **Invalid link**: The app will show an error without changing any saved data.
- **Storage unavailable**: Saving is disabled; the app will notify you and continue without persistence.
- **Version mismatch**: Shared or saved encounters created with an incompatible version cannot be loaded.
